# react-todo-app
A React Todo-App 

## Technologies used in this App

<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
  <li>ReactJs</li>
  <li>ReactHooks</li>
   <li>SweetAlert</li>
</ul>

## The reason for developing this site
It was a challenge for me to develop a finalized figma file with TailwindCss. This site contains 5 pages that are fully responsive.
Also it was a challenge for me to develope vanilla JavaScript components and reuse it on different pages.

## Development setup

#### First, clone the project:
git clone https://github.com/masoumehmohebbi/nike-shop/

#### Then, install necessary npm packages:
npm i
#### Finally, run the `dev` script and preview project on a local server:
npm run dev-tw

#### In order to format the code with Prettier, I uploaded prittier config file ".prettierrc".
